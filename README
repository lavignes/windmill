It wasn't really that hard. I did this afternoon. Writing all the math
classes was fun though. The only tough part was dealing with the fact
that C++'s template parser will choose to not include certain template class
methods in a compilation unit if they can be optimized away. Unfortunately, '__static_initialization_and_destruction_0': a "magic" function that runs class
static initialization is ignored when determining if templates should be
optimized away or not. (See the bottom of maths.cpp if you are curious) 
C++'s hidden horrible autogenerated functions are why I became a C programmer.
